This error typically arises when using Expo's `react-native-web` integration for web development. The root cause is often mismatched or conflicting versions of React Native Web packages.  The error message itself can be cryptic and might not directly point to the version issue, making it difficult to debug. Example error message:

`Unhandled Runtime Error: Module `react-native-web` is not found`
