The solution focuses on managing package versions within your `package.json` and ensuring a consistent version of `react-native-web` across all dependencies. Expo Go might have its own bundled version, causing the conflict. 

```javascript
// Correct package.json (bugSolution.js)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "^48.0.18",
    "expo-status-bar": ">=1.4.4 <2.0.0",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0",
    "react-native": "~0.71.8",
    "react-native-web": "^0.18.10" //Explicitly define version
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": ">=7.12.9",
    "@types/react": ">=18.0.26 <19.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": ">=18.0.11 <19.0.0",
    "typescript": ">=4.6.3" 
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

By explicitly specifying the version of `react-native-web`, we avoid potential conflicts that may arise from Expo's own version management. Using a compatible version of `react-native-web` with your specified `react-native` version is crucial.
